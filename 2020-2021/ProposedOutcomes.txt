Ability to create well-designed solutions to computing problems by analyzing needs, evaluating and creating efficient designs and implementing solutions. 
Ability to produce computing problem solutions within collaborative teams and clearly communicate technical ideas and concepts to others. 
Ability to utilize state-of-the-art techniques, skills and tools needed to operate and solve problems on technical teams. 
 Ability to learn and utilize new technologies and skills through self-directed learning. 

Thanks very much for pulling all of this information together so quickly.

I think it looks great and is exactly what we're looking for. I shared it with Toby, and he agrees. Indeed, he wanted me to emphasize how much he appreciates your hard work.

He would like the competitive market analysis to also include Carthage College, Carroll College, Marquette, and Rockford. Thanks, in advance, for adding this information into the document.

Toby and I brainstormed some basic programmatic learning outcomes: knowledge of hardware, knowledge of software, knowledge of a disciplinary field, and ability to work collaboratively in teams.  Thoughts? Would you add or substitute?

Thanks,


oby and I had a chance to chat about your proposed learning outcomes, and we are thinking something along the lines of:

Create and evaluate applied solutions to computing problems
Develop competency in a specialized area of computer science.
Successfully function in teams utilizing state-of-the-art tools and skills.
Engage in self-directed learning to employ new technologies and skills appropriate to the field of computer science.
Also, on your competitive market analysis, can you confirm what IBU is? Benedictine?
